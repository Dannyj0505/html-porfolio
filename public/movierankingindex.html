<h1>The Best Movies According to Danielle</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Mrs. Doubtfire</h3>
<p>I love Robin Williams. I love how his character is willing to do anything to see his family, even if it means wwearing a dress.</p>
<h3>Scary Movie 2</h3>
<p>Although it's kind of inappropriate, I love dark humor. Every scene is full of silliness. It's a parody a horror movie.</p>
<h3>Encanto</h3>
<p>This movie as more targeted to kids, but it's very beautiful and family oriented. The music will get stuck in your head and its amazing.</p>
